##Concept for scrum and terms

We need to make the first realese till 15.07

I purpose to make three or more realeases. 

The first one is the minimal viable product (MVP). 

Here are the critical functions that we need to develop.

1. Catalog

	
	1.1 Import from excel
	
	1.2 AJAX page load
	
	1.3 Search by name and code
	
	1.4 Feedback and order
	
	1.5 Admin 
		
	 1.5.1 Change item
	 
	 1.5.2 Create category and subcategory
	 
	1.6 Two filters price and producers for all 	categories
	
2. The second iterration can be done after the deadline, but it will be perfect to complete it earlier

	2.1 News and Admin news
	
	2.2 Articles and Admin articles
	
	2.3 Unlim filters
	
	2.4 Robokassa
	
3. Additional features that can be done after a deadline

	3.1 Import from letter
	
	3.2 Export from catalog
	
	3.3 All orders in admin page
	
	3.4 Watermarks in two copies
